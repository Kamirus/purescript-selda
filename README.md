# WIP

# TODO

- better implementation for EXPR, than EI - build ast, than string
- simple joins
- git branch cleanup
- structure cleanup, renames and restrict what modules export
- more restrict operators
- add restrictions to operators (Ord? Eq?)
- subqueries:
  - aggregate
  - IN / NOT IN
- order by
- limit
- default, sequenced primary key - do not insert those, but do select
